## Database Structures and Management with MySQL
#### database-structures-and-management-with-mysql
### module 2
#### Subqueries
 - A subquery is a query nested within another query, where the inner query (child) executes first and its results are used by the outer query (parent).
 - Subqueries must be enclosed in parentheses and can return various results, such as a single value, row, column, or multiple rows.
 Syntax: 
  ```sql
  SELECT column_name(s)
  FROM table_name
  WHERE column_name operator
  (SELECT column_name(s)
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition);
  ```
  - Subqueries and Comparison Operators
    - **Comparison Operators**: Used to compare values in a subquery with values in the main query.
    - **IN Operator**: Used to compare a value with a list of values.
    - **ANY Operator**: Used to compare a value with any value in a list.
    - **ALL Operator**: Used to compare a value with all values in a list.
    - **EXISTS Operator**: Used to check the existence of rows in a subquery.
    - **SOME Operator**: Used to compare a value with some values in a list.

      ```sql
      SELECT SUBSTRING(column_name, start_position, length) FROM table_name;
      ```

3. **Date Functions**: Date functions in MySQL are used to extract and format date and time values in various formats.
    - `CURDATE()`: Returns the current date.
        ```sql 
        SELECT CURDATE();   // Output: 2021-09-01
        ``` 
         
    - `CURTIME()`: Returns the current time.
       ```sql 
       SELECT CURTIME();    // Output: 12:00:00
       ```
    - `NOW()`: Returns the current date and time. 
        ```sql 
        SELECT NOW();    // Output: 2021-09-01 12:00:00
        ```
    - `DATE()`: Extracts the date part of a date or datetime expression.
        ```sql
        SELECT DATE(column_name) FROM table_name;  
        ```
    - `TIME()`: Extracts the time part of a date or datetime expression.

      ```sql
      SELECT column_name,
        CASE
          WHEN condition1 THEN result1
          WHEN condition2 THEN result2

      ```sql
      SELECT COALESCE(column1, column2, column3) FROM table_name;
      ```
    - `GREATEST()`: Returns the greatest value in a list.
        ```sql

        SELECT LEAST(column1, column2, column3) FROM table_name;
        ```

## Procedures
#### Procedures
-  Stored Procuders are a set of SQL statements that are stored in the database and can be executed on demand. They are used to encapsulate a set of operations or queries that need to be performed repeatedly.
- The stored procedure in MySQL is a set of SQL instructions wrapped within the CREATE PROCEDURE statement to achieve a particular objective. 
- Benefits include code consistency, reusability, and easier maintenance, reducing the need to rewrite the same SQL statements.
- To create a stored procedure, use the CREATE PROCEDURE command followed by the procedure name and parameters (if any), then write the procedure logic.
- To invoke a stored procedure, use the CALL command followed by the procedure name and parentheses.
- If a stored procedure is no longer needed, it can be removed using the DROP PROCEDURE command followed by the procedure name, without parentheses.
- The main idea behind creating stored procedures is to create reusable code that can be invoked and executed efficiently

Syntax:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name(parameter_value INT)
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE value = parameter_value;
```


## Advanced MySQL Topics
### Functions and Trigers

- Differences between functions and stored procedures

- Functions and procedures are used to encapsulate code that can be executed to implement repetitive tasks such as equations, formulas or business rules.

- In addition, functions and stored procedures make your code more consistent, reusable and easier to use and maintain. 

```sql
 SELECT * FROM Clinets;
 
 You can wrap this statement in a stored procedure as follows:

 DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetAllClients()
BEGIN
SELECT * FROM Clients;
END //
DELIMITER;

```
  Functions (Stored functions)                    |             STORED PROCEDURES   
--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------
1. Created using CREATE FUNCTION command          | Created using CREATE PROCEDURE command
2. Invoked using the SELECT statement             | Invoked using the CALL statement
3. Returns a single value                         | Can return multiple values
4. Takes IN parameters only                       | Can take IN, OUT, and INOUT parameters
5. Typically encapsulates common formulas or generic business rules | Typically used to process, manipulate and modify data in the database
6. Must specify the data type of the return value | User must specify the OUT parameter type
